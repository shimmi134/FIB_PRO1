Write a recursive function that computes the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b using the fast version of the Euclidean algorithm.

Interface

C++	
    int gcd(int a, int b);
C	
    int gcd(int a, int b);
Java	
    public static int gcd(int a, int b);
Python	
    gcd(a, b)  # returns int
 	
    gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int
Precondition

Neither a nor b are negative, and at least one of them is strictly greater than zero.

Observation You only need to submit the required procedure; your main program will be ignored.
